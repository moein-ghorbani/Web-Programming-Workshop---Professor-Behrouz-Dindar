## Gym Registration System

This project demonstrates a basic SQL database designed for a gym registration system. It includes the following tables:
- **Athletes**: To store athlete details.
- **Coaches**: To store coach information.
- **WorkoutPlans**: To assign and manage workout plans for athletes.

The project was developed as a sample assignment by a student, with special thanks to **Professor Behrooz Dindar** for his invaluable support and guidance.

Feel free to suggest improvements or use this project for learning purposes!
